Project idea :

Learning OS development is one of the most challenging programming tasks you can undertake. However, succeeding in your effort to build a working OS will mark you as a competent programmer and one who deeply understands how processors, hardware, and computer programs work together to create what the rest of the world takes for granted as a functioning computer.

Therefore, we aspire to build a simple operating system by hand and develop it in the future to become more efficient


What is the operating system?!


An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and system resources and provides the tools that applications need to operate. The birth of operating systems meant that programs no longer had to be written to control the entire scope of computer operation


Who's us ?!


The student team decided to build its operating system in an initial and simplified manner and then seeks to reach a distinguished and advanced stage, overcome the challenges and difficulties to reach a place befitting us.
